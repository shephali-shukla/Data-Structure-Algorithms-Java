#Array

-Array is a Linear Data Structure.
-Collection of homogenous items stored in contiguous memory locations.
-Array can be created for all primitive data types.
-Also, Java allows to store objects in an array that is called "Array of Objects".
-Array does not holds actual values but references to those values in memory.
-Unlike C/C++, Java initializes empty Array slots to 'null' in case of objects & to their respective default values in case of primitive data types.
